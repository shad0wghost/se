**WHEN PROMPTED** Selected `apache`

**To administer:** Navigate to `/var/www/html/se/admin` and execute the tools with `php <toolname>` then login into phpmyadmin and input values for pollers. 

If you need more information on how the pollers work navigate to `/var/www/html/se/pollers` and execute the tools via `php <toolname>` the debug output should give you enough to figure out what is needed.
